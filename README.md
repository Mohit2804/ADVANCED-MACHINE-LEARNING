Topic Modelling with LDA AND LSA Technique
# Introduction
In this project, I have used vaccination_all_tweets dataset, in order to implement topic modelling with LDA AND LSA techniques. We have used these two techniques and compared both of them to check which technique focuses best on the topic categories. However, we failed in getting the best outcome using LSA technique. We were unable to achieve any significant division throughout the topic groups, and it was hard to say if it was due to the decomposition of LSA or the t-SNE dimensionality reduction procedure. But, finally, we have got the superior outcome using LDA technique. Using t -SNE, it appears that LDA is successful in splitting the topic groups than LSA. As a result, LDA tends to be the better algorithm.
